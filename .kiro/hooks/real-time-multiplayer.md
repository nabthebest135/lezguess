# Real-Time Multiplayer Hook

This hook automatically manages Redis-based polling for real-time multiplayer within Devvit platform constraints.

## Trigger
- When multiplayer game mode is activated
- On player join/leave events
- On game state changes

## Actions
1. **Redis Polling Management**
   - Automatically establish polling intervals for room updates
   - Handle connection failures and retry logic
   - Manage multiple room polling efficiently

2. **State Synchronization**
   - Sync game state across all players using Redis
   - Handle conflict resolution for simultaneous actions
   - Ensure data consistency across clients

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Intelligent polling intervals (2-second updates)
   - Redis caching for frequently accessed data
   - Efficient data serialization and compression

## Benefits
- Real multiplayer experience within Devvit constraints
- Automatic polling management
- Reduced server load with smart caching
- Built-in error handling and recovery

## Platform Compliance
- Uses Redis instead of WebSockets (Devvit limitation)
- Polling-based updates for real-time feel
- Serverless-friendly architecture
